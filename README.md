# GlobeRushed
## By Kyle Crowley | Aaron Medlock | Talha Hassan
Globe Rushed is a fast paced geography guessing game that drops you somewhere in the world and gives you a handful of seconds to guess where you're at before your next leap. Guess right and you'll be rewarded with badges and a place on the leaderboard, guess wrong and lose points / rank. You can add and rank yourself amongst friends or a community.

If you want to play on your own here are the steps:
- In one folder clone down the repository and switch to the Backend branch
- In another folder clone the repository again and switch to the Frontend
- If the ec2 is running you can specify the url in the environments.ts as http://ec2-3-82-127-19.compute-1.amazonaws.com:9192
- If not set it to http://localhost:9192 and start the spring project
- You may need your own api key for google maps if you are running the site locally, and define it in environment.ts it would be bad if I provided it since this is public
