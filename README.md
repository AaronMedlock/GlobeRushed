Geography based guessing game where users are dropped in the world and need to use their immediate surroundings and context clues to guess what country you are in out of multiple options. 
You can add your friends and compete for the highest score on the leaderboards!

If you want to play on your own here are the steps:
- In one folder clone down the repository and switch to the Backend branch, delete the bin folder afterwards
- In another folder clone the repository again and switch to the Frontend
- If the ec2 is running you can specify the url in the environments.ts as http://ec2-3-82-127-19.compute-1.amazonaws.com:9192
- If not set it to http://localhost:9192 and start the spring project
- You may need your own api key for google maps if you are running the site locally, and define it in environment.ts it would be bad if I provided it since this is public
